Project Name: Data Acquistion System

Technology: Microcontroller + RTOS

Project Summary:
The project is based on taking the ADC values on real time basis through
FreeRTOS ported in LPC1768 board. The ADC values are then trasmitted to
computer via UART. Xenomai framework has been ported to the computer to
take the data. The data is then sent to user space via pipe. Finally the pipe is
read by GTK which plots the ADC values on the graph.
